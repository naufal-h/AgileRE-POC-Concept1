# POC Concept One: Integration of Two Applications

## Project Description

This is a Proof of Concept (POC) to demonstrate that by integrating two applications, we can input (input a) to generate output (output b) and use output b to produce output c.

## Main Concept

- **Input A**: Project Description
- **Output B**: Use Case
- **Output C**: Activity Diagram

### Workflow

1. **Input A (Project Description)** is entered into **Application 1 (Ucase)**.
2. **Application 1** processes the input and produces **Output B (Use Case)**.
3. **Output B (Use Case)** is used as input for **Application 2 (UseCaseSpecToSequence)**.
4. **Application 2** processes the input and produces **Output C (Activity Diagram)**.

## Project Structure

This project uses Django with a multiple apps concept to separate the logic and functionality of the two applications.

- **Application 1: Ucase**

  - Takes input in the form of a project description.
  - Generates a use case based on the project description.

- **Application 2: UseCaseSpecToSequence**
  - Takes the use case generated by Application 1.
  - Generates an activity diagram based on the use case specification.

## Installation and Usage

1. **Clone this repository:**

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
   cd repository
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

Make sure you have Python and pip installed. Then run:

```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Migrate the database:**
   Run the migration commands to prepare the database:

```bash
   python manage.py migrate
```

4. **Run the server**
   Start the Django development server:

```bash
    python manage.py runserver
```

5. **Access the application:**
   Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to start using the application.

## How It Works

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. Create Django Apps:

Use the following commands to create the Django applications:

```bash
    python manage.py startapp app1
    python manage.py startapp app2
```

2. Add apps to INSTALLED_APPS:

Edit your settings.py to include the new apps:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'app1',
    'app2',
]
```

3. Configure Models:

Define the models for each app. For example, in `app1/models.py`

4. Define Views:

Create views to handle the input and output for each application. For example, in `app1/views.py`

5. Set Up URLs:

Configure the URLs for each application. In `ucase/urls.py`

6. Create Templates:

Create the necessary HTML templates for each application. For example, `app1/templates/template.html`
